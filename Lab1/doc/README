Files:
myserver.c  //the c file with the code for the server
myclient.c  //the c file with the code for the client 
mytest      //the test for the server 

As of currently what does not work in my program is: 
	
UNIX commands:
•	Last 
•	Ps aux 
•	Set

these three commands cause segmentation faults within the code. dont know why it does that.
to fix this problem exit out of both client and server and restart both to resume operation

One of the problems experienced is that after i run a bad command. something that the unix cant
process. it will return with a new client line but another bad command  will break the client side
system. The way to fix it is to kill the server and then kill the client. and restart accordingly.

-caveat with the command line: if you keep entering good commands into "client $" most will return

everything should be tested except those UNIX commands that i have tried on my own.
